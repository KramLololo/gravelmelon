# Hide Discord Sidebar
A web browser extension to hide the friend, channel and server list on the [Discord web app](https://discord.com/app).

## Usage
1. Click on the extension in the extension list while on https://discord.com/app in order to hide the sidebar.
2. Click on it again if you want to unhide the sidebar.
3. Press **Alt+G** to toggle it from your keyboard instead of with your mouse.

## Motivation
I created it to help when using Discord with a big font so the sidebar doesn't get in the way while using a channel.
Additional use cases:
- Hide the sidebar for better screenshots
- Hide the sidebar to prevent others from seeing your friends or servers
- Prevent distractions
- Make room in order to see a text channel or images easily
- Live streaming
- Using Discord and another app on the same monitor
