# Hide Discord Sidebar
A web browser extension to hide the friend, channel and server list on the [Discord web app](https://discord.com/app).

## Installation
This extension hasn't been published to an extension marketplace yet. (If you want me to publish it, then create an issue, [email me](mailto:markbgmc@gmail.com) or just star the repository.)
To install the extension on your browser you can take the following steps:
1. Download the ZIP archive from https://github.com/KramLololo/gravelmelon/archive/refs/heads/main.zip.
2. Extract it
3. Visit your browser's extension manager. On most browsers you can type `about://extensions` in your address bar to get there quickly.
4. Find and press the toggle to enable developer mode on the extension manager.
5. Find and press the button that says "Load unpacked".
6. Select the folder which you extracted in step 2.
7. Make sure the extension was installed successfully by finding it in your extension list.

If you run into an issue, you can try to find a different tutorial online by searching "Load unpacked extension".

## Usage
1. Click on the extension in the extension list while on https://discord.com/app in order to hide the sidebar.
2. Click on it again if you want to unhide the sidebar.
3. Press **Alt+G** to toggle it from your keyboard instead of with your mouse.

## Motivation
I created it to help when using Discord with a big font so the sidebar doesn't get in the way while using a channel.
Additional use cases:
- Hide the sidebar for better screenshots
- Hide the sidebar to prevent others from seeing your friends or servers
- Prevent distractions
- Make room in order to see a text channel or images easily
- Live streaming
- Using Discord and another app on the same monitor

A tribute to @Gravelmelon.
